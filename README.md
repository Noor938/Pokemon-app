Pokémon App README
-Project Overview
This Pokémon app is a web application designed to provide detailed information about various Pokémon. Built using GraphQL and Tailwind CSS, the app utilizes the Pokémon API v8 to fetch Pokémon data and display it through dynamic, visually appealing cards.

-Features
Pokémon Cards: Displays Pokémon information on responsive, styled cards using Tailwind CSS.
Dynamic Search: Client-side search functionality allows users to quickly find specific Pokémon.
GraphQL Integration: Fetches real-time Pokémon data via Apollo Client and GraphQL queries.

-Issues Encountered
-Initially, the app used the getFuzzyPokemon query, but it did not return accurate results. As a solution, a client-based search feature was developed to provide more reliable search results.
